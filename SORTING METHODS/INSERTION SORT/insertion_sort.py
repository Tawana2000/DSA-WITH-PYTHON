#Insertion sort works by repeatedly
"""
- Taking an element from the unsorted portion of the list
- And inserting it into its correct position within the already sorted portion
"""
#Working of insertion sort
"""
1. Divide the list into sorted and unsorted sublists
- Initially we assume the first element is sorted (because there is only one element), and the rest of the list is unsorted.
2. Set the first unsorted element  as the key element.
3. Compare the key with the elements of the sorted sublist (moving from right to left) and insert it into its correct position.
4. Repeat step 3 for all the elements of the unsorted part.
