#You run a small laundry service. After washing and drying, you end up with a pile of single socks. Each sock is tagged with a size number (e.g., 6, 8, 10, etc.). You want to sort the socks from smallest to largest by size before pairing them.
#You decide to use a very simple sorting method — Bubble Sort — to arrange the socks.

"""
Given the following sock sizes in a random pile:

sock_sizes = [10, 6, 8, 7, 9, 6, 11]


Use Bubble Sort to sort the sock sizes in ascending order.
