# You are given a list of 2D points (x, y)

Sort the points using Quick Sort based on:
- Distance from the origin (0, 0), smaller distance first
- If distance are equal -> Smaller x first
- if x si also equal -> smaller y first


Input

    (1, 1),
    (0, 2),
    (2, 2),
    (1, 2),
    (0, 0)
]


Expected Output

[
    (0, 0),
    (1, 1),
    (0, 2),
